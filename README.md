# WordCountLookUp

### Welcome to Word Count Lookup <span style="color:rgb(51, 255, 0);">version 1.1!</span>  

**What this project does:**  
A user can input a word count (such as 42069, 42,069, 42.069 for something that has that many words), and the program will return a popular book with a similar word count.  

The user can ask for further information about the book and/or the length it took to read their inputed word count!  

**Please note:** the list of books are books I hand picked by ones that I have read or know of because it is more fun that way.  
Yes, I could have found a public library with that information and scrapped it, but I only wanted books that I have heard of.  
Feel free to fork this repo and change that to your hearts desire.  

**Updates:**  
<span style="color:rgb(20, 160, 51)">Version 1.0</span> = release of project ðŸ¥³  
<span style="color:rgb(51, 255, 0)">Version 1.1</span> = added much needed error handling ðŸ’€


<span style="color: hsl(212, 100.00%, 61.80%)">**Come back later for future implementations of this project!**</span>  

Planned future features! ðŸ‘€ :  
- Include feature to search by book first
- Include feature to search by time read
- Predictability (not AI) of how long it will take to read based on word count  

**End goal:**  
- My end goal is to make this a mobile app! ðŸ¥³
  - (No idea when that will happen tho ðŸ’€ but stay tuned!)  
  - (and side note: fuck ios, sorry android only unless you want to pay for apple app development software)
- Will also make this a web app as well most likely (but that is not priority)
