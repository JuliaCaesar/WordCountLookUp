# WordCountLookUp

### Welcome to Word Count Lookup <span style="color: green;">version 1!</span>  

**What this project does:**  
A user can input a word count (such as 1548 for something that has that many words), and the program will return a popular book with a similar word count.  

The user can ask for further information about the book and/or the length it took to read their inputed word count!  

**FOR THE USER INPUT:** when inputing a word count, please do not add any commas.  
(This will cause it to error, I might fix it later, who knows ðŸ™ƒ)  

Please note: the list of books are books I hand picked by ones that I have read or know of because it is more fun that way.  
Yes, I could have found a public library with that information and scrapped it, but I only wanted books that I have heard of.  
Feel free to fork this repo and change that to your hearts desire.  

**Come back later for future implementations of this project!**
